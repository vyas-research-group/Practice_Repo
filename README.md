# Practice_Repo
This is a practice repository I have created for the group. I am going to give each of you a small task. to get used to working with git and github I plan for you to pull down the repository, make a branch. add a file with something in it, and then push that branch up to the github.

This is great. I am glad we did the 4/19 group meeting. svyas
